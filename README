MetroBoy is a playable, circuit-level simulation of an entire Game Boy.

----------

TL;DR - Drag and drop rom files into the window to load them.

Game controls:

Dpad = arrow keys
B = Z
A = X
Select = shift
Start = enter

Debug controls:

R = Reset
F = Fast mode
V = Vsync mode (default)
S = Step mode
F1 = Load state
F4 = Save state
ESC = Quit

In step mode, up/down changes step granularity (frame/line/cycle) and left/right steps forward/back. Shift-right can be used to step over long instructions like loops and halts.

----------

MetroBoy isn't an emulator in the traditional sense - it's comparatively slow, though you can use it to play Game Boy games. It should run at full speed on most modern processors, with my current laptop running at about 2.5x realtime in fast mode.

MetroBoy is more like a Verilog simulation of a Game Boy that's been translated into C++. You can also think of it as being written in a synthesizable subset of C++.

MetroBoy is designed to be mechanically translated into Verilog.

MetroBoy is part of a larger project named Metron, which is a C-to-Verilog translator based on LLVM that I'm still working on.

Portions of MetroBoy have been validated by translating them from C to Verilog using Metron, translating that back to C using Verilator, then asserting that all the registers match up.

MetroBoy usually runs between 3x-5x faster than the C->Verilog->Verilator->C version.

Known Issues

- The code is a mix of DMG (original Game Boy) and AGS (Game Boy Advance SP) configurations and will fail a few compatibility tests due to the inconsistency.
- The sound hardware implementation is buggy
- Save game support isn't implemented yet
